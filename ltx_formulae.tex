% NOTE: In Jupyter, the LTX code will need to be between $ signs. Also the \large makes the text larger.

% Relating charge's/electron's k.e. through a pot. difference, V:

\large \frac{1}{2} m_{e} v^{2}_{e} = e V 

% Isolated charge's velocity as a function of V

\large v^{2}_{e} = \frac{2Ve}{m_{e}}

% LORENTZ FORCE: Magnitude of Lorentz force (magnetic)

\large \lvert F_{m} \rvert = \lvert -e(\vec{v_{e}} \times \vec{B}) \rvert 

% LORENTZ FORCE: Magnitude of Lorentz force (magnetic and electric)

\large \lvert F_{m} \rvert = \lvert -e(\vec{\varepsilon} + \vec{v_{e}} \times \vec{B}) \rvert 

% Velcoity of charge/electroon in relation to magnitude of magnetic field, the radius of the charge's trajectory and the charge-mass ratio:

\large v^{2}_{e}=B^{2}R^{2}_{beam} (\frac{e}{m_{e}})^{2}

% The Voltage in terms of the cnostant of proportionality linking magnetic field to current, the current, and the radius of the trajectory, and below it the 
% gradient of the V vs i^2 graph:

\large V = \frac{1}{2} k^{2}_{coils} i^{2} R^{2}_{beam} \frac{e}{m_{e}}

\large m = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{8\mu_{0}}{5\sqrt{5}}\frac{N}{R_{coils}})^{2} R^{2}_{beam} \frac{e}{m_{e}}
