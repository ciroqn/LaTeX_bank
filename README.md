# LaTeX Bank

GitHub, as far as I am aware, cannot render LaTeX (LTX) in .md files, but Jupyter Notebooks can render LTX `$ ... $` using inline, and `$$...$$` for larger chunks of LTX code. This would have to be written in a Markdown cell in Jupyter.

I have compiled a bank of equations and formulae I have used in Jupyter for easy access.
